# QuickSortMaxeler
The present code is a Final Project for Topics in Systems Subject during Summer 2016 at Indiana University.

QuickSort is an efficient Sort Algorithm which uses the technique to divide and conquer, this means that the overall set of numbers
is converted a subset that is getting sorted so at the end is returning a complete sort result.

This project implementation was done using MaxJ 5.1 and using the paradigm of DataFlow Computing for optimization.
